[i]I called the police on Nico, and fled the town as fast I could.
[i]My parent's didn't understand why I couldn't stay for Christmas, but I didn't expect them to... I knew they wouldn't be able to understand...
[i]Back in the big city, I thought I'd be able to leave everything behind.
[i]Christmas morning, I woke up prepared to have a quiet morning, trying everything in my power to push [b]that man[/b] out of my memory.
[i]I looked to my alarm clock to check the time...
[i]And found a single torn notebook page lying there.
[i]Scrawled in messy handwriting, in dark bleeding black ink...
[i][b]Enjoy your coal, b-word - Santa <3
