[i]I hadn’t seen Nico since that night.[/i]
[i]As Christmas has drawn closer, he’s gotten more and more busy at the post office.[/i]
# #[i]But a part of me is worried he’s avoiding me…[/i]

[i]He’s always so generous and thoughtful with me, so I wanted to return the favor.[/i]
# he’s a good gift giver

[i]But honestly more than that… I miss him.[/i]

[i]The post office is empty, like the first time I visited.[/i]

[i]I remember when we first met, I was so cold to him.[/i]

[i]But somehow, over this short holiday, we’ve gotten so close.[/i]

[i]Steadying it, I notice a small maroon journal sitting on the table with a title scrawled on in sharpie\:[/i]
[i]Nico’s Notebook[/i]
update christine (side/casual/blush) center
[i]Of course he’s the type of guy who journals, that’s just like him.[/i]
[i]…I kinda want to take a peek.[/i]

- Pick it up

	[i]Unable to resist, I pick up the notebook, and open to the first page.[/i]
	join christine (front/casual/happy) center [animation="Fade In"]
	[i]Smiling to myself, I begin to read.[/i]
- Leave it alone
	update christine (side/casual/neutral)
	[i]I decide it’s better to respect Nico’s privacy and leave the notebook alone.[/i]
	[i]I pick it up to put it safely behind the counter, when I trip over a fold in the rug and drop it.[i]
	leave christine [animation="Slide Out Down"]
	[i]It lands open to a blank black page.[/i]
	# #{mc}\: That’s strange, I’ve never seen a notebook with black pages before.
