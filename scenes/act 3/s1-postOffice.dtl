- Pick it up
	[i]Unable to resist, I pick up the notebook, and open to the first page.[/i]
	[i]Smiling to myself, I begin to read.[/i]
- Leave it alone
	[i]I decide it’s better to respect Nico’s privacy and leave the notebook alone.[/i]
	[i]I pick it up to put it safely behind the counter, when I trip over a fold in the rug and drop it.[i]
	[i]It lands open to a blank black page.[/i]
	#{mc}\: That’s strange, I’ve never seen a notebook with black pages before.
[i]I pick it up off the floor and quickly realize that it’s not a black page…[/i]
[i]it’s ink.[/i]

#MUSIC FADE OUT AND CREEPY MUSIC START
#[as she reads, we slowly zoom into her anxious face, and her eyes are animated wavering back and forth]
[i]Names upon names are scribbled in the tiniest font, leaving barely a hint of any white space left.[/i]
[i]I frantically search for a name that I recognize…[/i]
[i]And I find my own.[/i]
{name.first} {name.last}
[i]There’s a number in parentheses to the right of my name, and I quickly flip to the page.[/i]
[i]Black ink seeps into almost every corner. The words are barely legible, but I can still make out the phrases:[/i]
{name.first} {name.last}:
Favorite food: {fav.food}, favorite drink: {fav.drink}...
Favorite cookie: {fav.cookie}... favorite Christmas song: {fav.song}...
The list continues on…
[i]My likes, dislikes, my place of work, all the cities I’ve ever lived, life milestones, life tragedies, things that even my mother doesn’t know…[/i]
{mc}\: What the fuck… 
{n}\: {name.first} is that you?
{n}\: What are you doing here? 
#NICOS FACE FALLS
{n}\: You shouldn’t be reading that...
{mc}\: Nico… what is this?
#does he take the book away? I’ll say no for now
{n}\: It’s nothing.
{mc}\: Nico… tell me what this is.
#Nico is silent, looking worried
{mc}\: How do you know so much about me? Why do you have it written down?
{mc}\: And, who are all these people?!
{n}\: …
{mc}\: Nico, answer me!
{n}\: …I’ll tell you but promise not to freak out.
{mc}\: I’m already freaking out.
{mc}\:I don’t know if you could say [i]anything[/i] to make this situation worse!!
{n}\: Just- just stay calm!
{mc}\: You expect me to stay calm in this situation?!?!
{n}\: You have a right to be upset, but-
{mc}\: Just get to the point.
{n}\: I-
{n}\: [sighs]
[wait_input]
{n}\: I’m Santa Claus.
[wait_input]
{mc}\: Nico, what the fuck…
{n}\: Nico, Nicolas! St Nick? Nicolas Claus?
{mc}\: ...
{mc}\: I'm leaving.
{n}\: {name.first} wait!

{n}\: Please listen to me! I swear I'm telling the truth!!
{n}\: I work at the post office because it’s my job to deliver presents!! 
{n}\: Did you really think Santa could give out all those presents in just one night??! That’s impossible!!!
{n}\: [i]That’s[/i] why I know so much about you! 
{n}\: That’s why I have this book!
{n}\: And… I need you to know that I’m only telling you this because you mean so much to me.
{n}\: I didn’t- I didn’t expect to feel this way about you.
{n}\: I knew you were going through a rough time, and I just wanted to make you feel better when we ran into each other.
{n}\: But somewhere along the way…
{n}\: I fell in love with you…
#MC: silent eyes shaking omg thoughts grappling
