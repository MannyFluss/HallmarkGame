[i]I hadn’t seen Nico since that night.[/i]
[i]As Christmas has drawn closer, he’s gotten more and more busy at the post office.[/i]
# #[i]But a part of me is worried he’s avoiding me…[/i]
[i][door chime jingles]

[i]Today, I finally decided to stop by with some {fav.drink}, his favorite.[/i]
[i]He’s always so generous and thoughtful with me, so I wanted to return the favor.[/i]
# he’s a good gift giver 
[i]But honestly more than that… I miss him.[/i]
# [i]And I want to understand what that night under the mistletoe meant.[/i]
[i]I look around the post office, setting the cup on a table near the center of the room.[/i]
{mc}\: Hello? Nico?
[i]The post office is empty, like the first time I visited.[/i]
[i]I remember when we first met, I was so cold to him.[/i]
[i]But somehow, over this short holiday, we’ve gotten so close.[/i]
[i]I’ve never met someone so joyful and warm.[/i]
[i]It doesn’t take long to see how much the people of this small town love him.[/i]
[i]How much I think that I too might actually…[/i]
[i]Love him??![/i]
[i]Frantic with this newfound revelation, I swing my arms around and almost knock over the cup.[/i]
[i]Steadying it, I notice a small maroon journal sitting on the table with a title scrawled on in sharpie\:[/i]
[i]Nico’s Notebook[/i]
[i]Of course he’s the type of guy who journals, that’s just like him.[/i]
[i]…I kinda want to take a peek.[/i]

- Pick it up
	[i]Unable to resist, I pick up the notebook, and open to the first page.[/i]
	[i]Smiling to myself, I begin to read.[/i]
- Leave it alone
	[i]I decide it’s better to respect Nico’s privacy and leave the notebook alone.[/i]
	[i]I pick it up to put it safely behind the counter, when I trip over a fold in the rug and drop it.[i]
	[i]It lands open to a blank black page.[/i]
	# #{mc}\: That’s strange, I’ve never seen a notebook with black pages before.
	[i]I pick it up off the floor and quickly realize that it’s not a black page…[/i]

	[i]It’s ink.[/i]

# #[as she reads, we slowly zoom into her anxious face, and her eyes are animated wavering back and forth]
[i]Names upon names are scribbled in the tiniest font, leaving barely a hint of any white space left.[/i]
[i]I frantically search for a name that I recognize…[/i]
[i]And I find my own.[/i]
{name.first} {name.last}
[i]There’s a number in parentheses to the right of my name, and I quickly flip to the page.[/i]
[i]Black ink seeps into almost every corner. The words are barely legible, but I can still make out the phrases\:[/i]
{name.first} {name.last}\:
Favorite food\: {fav.food}, favorite drink\: {fav.drink}...
Favorite Christmas song\: {fav.song}...
The list continues on…
[i]My likes, dislikes, my place of work, all the cities I’ve ever lived, life milestones, life tragedies, things that even my mother doesn’t know…[/i]

{n}\: I work at the post office because it’s my job to deliver presents!!
{n}\: Did you really think Santa could give out all those presents in just one night??! That’s impossible!!!
{n}\: [i]That’s[/i] why I know so much about you!
{n}\: That’s why I have this book!
{n}\: And… I need you to know that I’m only telling you this because you mean so much to me.
