# Internal company meeting, no powerpoints since this is the 80s, maybe a poster 
As you can see, the new state of the art model works like a charm!
Simply by adjusting the settings, we can now control the dropping skill and claw strength of the crane.
The power is in [i]your own hands[/i] to control the odds!

Furthermore, I’m delighted to announce an upcoming partnership with the beloved pizza chain Koko’s.
Soon, you’ll be able to see MEGA branded claw machines in your local pizza shop, just in time for the holiday season!

And for a limited time, we’ll be featuring custom holiday stuffed animals modeled after the restaurant’s mascot, Koko the gecko.
Kids will be lining up around the block to get a chance for their very own Koko!
This partnership is expected to drive overall revenue through increasing the number of players playing, the time spent playing, and the capital users are willing to invest.
We estimate that by the end of this fiscal year, we will see a 150% growth in our profits.

MR. FLUSS\: Wonderful job yet again!
MISS MONICA\: The shareholders are going to love this.

Any questions?

MR. STONE\: How do you expect to deal with potential backlash of including our product in family establishments?
MR. STONE\: Since we’ve started expanding in the American market, we’ve received accusations that these games are marketing gambling towards children.
# #MR STONE: Has PR been involved? 
MR. FLUSS\: Hey, we’re here to make money, not save the world.

No, he makes a great point. Thank you for your question.
# #PR has been involved in this project since the beginning, so we’re covered on all bases with them.
# #But to answer your first question…


- It's like the lottery
	But I’d like to ask you a question in return.
	update christine (front/work/headshot/angry)
	When you buy a lottery ticket, are you genuinely expecting to win?
	[i][inquisitive muttering][/i]
	update christine (front/work/headshot/happy)
	No! You’re buying it for the fantasy.
	To be able to spend a week where you can imagine what your life would be like if you had that much money.
	We’re giving children the joy of possibility!

- It's like life
	We’re teaching kids about the harsh realities of life.
	update christine (front/work/headshot/angry)
	Not everyone can be a winner.
	update christine (front/work/headshot/happy)
	However, if you put in enough time, sweat, and dedication, it’ll eventually pay off!
	It’s not like these machines are [i]impossible![/i]
	update christine (front/work/headshot/neutral)
	MR. FLUSS\: Just rigged!
	[i][laughter][/i]

MR. STONE\: Well! We’re at time! Let’s go for lunch.
MISS MONICA\: Let’s go to Koko’s! I want to try their new holiday seasonal\: peppermint pizza!
MR. FLUSS\: Ugh what?
[i]People begin to stand and file out of the conference room.[/i]
VP\: Keep up the great work! I see partner status in your future.
update christine (34/work/happy)
Thank you ma’am.
# #VP\: Expect a [i]very[/i] generous Christmas bonus. 
# #VP\: Happy holidays!

[i]Once she leaves, I’m left alone, and a silence settles over the conference room that was bustling with noise just a few minutes ago.[/i]
# #[i]I’m finally able to catch my breath.[/i]
[i]Did I really just defend gambling for children to a room full of executives?[/i]
# #[i]And did they just buy it?[/i]
join christine (34/work/neutral) center
[i]Anyways, I’m at least glad this project is finally over.[/i]
# #[i]This was the first project they allowed me to lead completely on my own.[/i]
[i]I’m happy it was a huge success, but I’m not surprised. I know I’m good at my job.[/i]
# #[i]I put so many long nights into this project, talked to so many incompetent partners, all to pull this off.[/i]
# #[i]If things didn’t result in a massive success then I’d be pissed.[/i]
[i]I put so many long nights into this project, so I’m relieved, but…[/i]
update christine (34/work/sad)
[i]I can’t help but feel a bit guilty.[/i]
[i]What’s worse\: taking candy from a baby, or dangling it in front of them, just out of reach.
# #[i][sighs][/i]
# #[i]At least the pay is good…[/i]
