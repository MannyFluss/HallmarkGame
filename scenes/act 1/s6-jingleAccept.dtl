{n}\: I’ll meet you at the base of the Jingle Jangle tree!
{n}\: It’s right in the center of the market and the tree is MASSIVE, extremely hard to miss!
{mc}\: Well, I’ll see you there, I guess.
{n}\: Yep! See you tonight! Looking forward to it!
#{n}\: The Jingle Jangle is one of my favorite festivities! Though they’re all kind of tied for first on my list!
{n}\: There's no way you won't have fun! I swear you won’t regret it!
{mc}\: Well, I’ve got to be heading back now.
{n}\: Merry Christmas! Have a great night!
