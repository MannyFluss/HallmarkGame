[i]I quickly opened the door to the post office, grateful to finally escape the frigid winter air.[/i]
[i]As I stepped inside, I was enveloped in the faint smell of sweet cinnamon and pine, and the warmth from a fire crackling in the fireplace.[/i]
[i]I looked around and suddenly felt like I just walked into someone’s home.[/i]
[i]There were thick rugs layed on the floor, a miniature Christmas village displayed on the fireplace mantle, and garlands strung up along the corners of the room.[/i]
[i]The post office was completely empty, and I started to fear that I actually did break into some poor grandma’s house.[/i]
{mc}\: Hello? Anyone there?
MAN’S VOICE\: Coming!
[i]I busied myself looking at some stamps on the counter until the mailman arrived.[/i]

{mc}\: I mean- yes! I mean, I had some packages to deliver.
{mc}\: Do I just drop them off here?
MAILMAN\: Haha! Yup! This is the only post office for the next 50 miles.
MAILMAN\: So how are you liking it here? Have you explored the town square yet?
{mc}\: Ah… Is it that easy to tell I’m not from around here?
MAILMAN\: You say that like it’s a bad thing!
# he says haha every 5 seconds because he’s just a chill guy

# he is shocked
{mc}\: How do you know that?
{n}\: You’re part of the {name.last} family, right? Your folks are so nice.
{n}\: Your mother was telling me her daughter was visiting this year. I hear you’re a big shot in the city.
{mc}\: She said that? Oh my god…
{n}\: Well, while you’re here, you should make sure to enjoy yourself!
{n}\: There’s the Jingle Jangle Christmas Twinkle Sparkle Tree Lighting Ceremony and Market tonight. You should go!
{mc}\: I don’t know, those kinds of things aren’t really my style.
