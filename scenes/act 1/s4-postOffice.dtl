[i]I quickly opened the door to the post office, grateful to finally escape the frigid winter air.[/i]
[i]As I stepped inside, I was enveloped in the faint smell of sweet cinnamon and pine, and the warmth from a fire crackling in the fireplace.[/i]
[i]I looked around and suddenly I felt like I just walked into someone’s home.[/i]
[i]There were thick rugs layed on the floor, a miniature Christmas village displayed on the fireplace mantle, and garlands strung up along the corners of the room.[/i]
[i]The post office was completely empty, and I started to fear that I actually did break into some poor grandma’s house.[/i]
{mc}\: Hello? Anyone there?
MAN’S VOICE\: Coming!
[i]I busied myself looking at some stamps on the counter until the postman arrived.[/i]
[i]But I felt my heart skip as I looked up and locked eyes with his [br] [pause=0.3][b]icy[pause=0.5] blue [pause=0.5]orbs.[/b]
# #swoop in nico
# #make her blush
{mc}\: …
MAILMAN\: Can I help you?
{mc}\: …[pause=0.5]No!
{mc}\: I mean- yes! I mean, I had some packages to deliver.
{mc}\: Do I just drop them off here?
MAILMAN\: Haha! Yup! This is the only post office for the next 50 miles.
MAILMAN\: So how are you liking it here? Have you explored the town square yet?
{mc}\: Ah… Is it that easy to tell I’m not from around here?
MAILMAN\: You say that like it’s a bad thing, haha!
# he says haha every 5 seconds because he’s just a chill guy
{n}\: I’m Nico by the way!
{mc}\: I’m {name.first}.
{n}\: {name.first} {name.last}?
# he is shocked
{mc}\: How do you know that?
{n}\: You’re part of the {name.last} family, right? Your folks are so nice.
{n}\: Your mother was telling me her daughter was visiting this year. I hear you’re a big shot in the city.
{mc}\: She said that? Oh my god…
{n}\: Well, while you’re here, you should make sure to enjoy yourself!
{n}\: There’s the Jingle Jangle Christmas Twinkle Sparkle Tree Lighting Ceremony and Market tonight.
{mc}\: I don’t know, those kinds of things aren’t really my style.
{n}\: What?!
{n}\: Even if you don’t celebrate Christmas, it’s still a good time, I swear!
{n}\: How about we go together?
[i]What?![i]
[i]Is he asking me out on a date?!?[/i]
[i]WHAT DO I SAY?!?!?![/i]
