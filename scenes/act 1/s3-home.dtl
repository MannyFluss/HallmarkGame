# she arrives at home
{mc}\: So this is the new place?
[i]I look around at the cabin that my mother very clearly lovingly and meticulously decorated for the holidays.[/i]
MOM\: Isn’t it wonderful?
{mc}\: It sure is.
MOM\: I know it may not seem like much compared to the big city, but your father and I are very happy here.
#MOM\: Everyone here is so friendly, and you can tell that they really love Christmas.
#{mc}\: Yeah I’ve never seen so many Christmas lights before. People here really go all out,huh?
MOM\: You should go out and explore, get to know the people in town!
MOM\: Oh wait! Before that...
MOM\: Here, I have these presents for Uncle Manny.
MOM\: I forgot Hanukkah started earlier this year, so I need you to go to the post office now to deliver them.
{mc}\: I’ve been home for less than 10 minutes and you’re already putting me to work?
MOM\: And here I thought you loved work?
MOM\: So much so that you didn’t come to see your poor mother for Christmas.
{mc}\: Fine, fine, I understand. I’m sorry, I’ll go deliver them.
MOM\: The post office is in the town square, but while you’re out there, walk around, have some fun!
MOM\: Sure, Mom.
MOM\: Oh, have some Christmas spirit!
MOM\: You should spend more time caring about your loved ones than that job, you know.
MOM\: I gotta run some more errands so I’ll see you later! Love you darling!
{mc}\: Love you too…
