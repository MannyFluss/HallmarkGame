{mc}\: So this is the new place?
[i]I look around at the cabin that my mother lovingly and meticulously decorated for the holidays.[/i]
MOM\: Isn’t it wonderful? Your father and I are so happy we moved here.
# #{mc}\: It sure is.
# #MOM\: I know it may not seem like much compared to the big city, but your father and I are very happy here.
# #MOM\: Everyone here is so friendly, and you can tell that they really love Christmas.
# #{mc}\: Yeah I’ve never seen so many Christmas lights before. People here really go all out,huh?
MOM\: You should explore the area, get to know the people in town!
MOM\: Oh, wait! Before that!
MOM\: Here, I have these presents for Uncle Manny.
MOM\: I forgot Hanukkah started earlier this year, so I need you to go now to the post office to deliver them.
- Deliver the presents
	{mc}\: You got it, Mom.
	MOM\: Thank you darling!
	MOM\: It’s so nice having you home for Christmas this year.
	MOM\: We really missed you last Christmas. That job’s taking up too much of your time, you know!
	MOM\: The post office is in the town square, but while you’re out there, walk around, have some fun!
- Try to get out of it
	{mc}\: I’ve been home for less than 10 minutes and you’re already putting me to work?
	MOM\: And here I thought you loved work?
	MOM\: So much so that you didn’t come to see your poor mother last Christmas.
	{mc}\: Fine, fine, I understand. I’m sorry, I’ll go deliver them.
	MOM\: The post office is in the town square, but while you’re out there, walk around, have some fun!
	# #{mc}\: Sure, Mom.
	# #MOM\: Oh, have some Christmas spirit!
	# #MOM\: You should spend more time caring about your loved ones than that job, you know!

MOM\: I gotta run some more errands, so I’ll see you later! Love you darling!
{mc}\: Love you too.
