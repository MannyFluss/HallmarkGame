# at the aiport
[i]The airport is bustling with noise as people prepare to fly home for the holidays.[/i]
[i]I still can’t understand why my parents decided to move to some random small town.
[i]Ever since they moved up north a couple years ago, I haven’t had a chance to visit.
[i]Work has just been so crazy. And sometimes I begin to question if it’s even worth it.
# #[i]Honestly, I can’t remember the last time I was able to just rest out in the past few years.
# #[i]Let alone even begin to think about Christmas.
# #[i]Speaking of, thank god I was able to get my Christmas shopping done in time before this flight.
# #[i]I have no idea what they’ll even have in stock in their little dinky town.

[i]Maybe disconnecting will be for the best.
[i]Getting away from the city just might be the reset I need.

LITTLE CHILD\: Mommy! Mommy! I want to write a letter to Santa!
[i]I look up and spot a festive gingerbread themed workstation in front of the gate across from mine.[/i]
[i]There’s a guy dressed in a badly made elf costume encouraging people to participate.[/i]
ELF\: Donate $2.50 and write a letter to Santa! All proceeds go to families in need this winter!

[i]Letter to Santa, huh…[/i]
[i]I remember when I was a kid, I would write to Santa every year.[/i]
# [i]Even with my impossible requests, I always ended up with a present that I loved or something that I needed.[/i]
# #[i]Even if I couldn’t quite appreciate it at the time.[/i]
[i]One year, I remember asking Santa for a friend.
[i]I was never quite good at making friends. To be honest, I’m still not very good.[/i]
[i]But that Christmas, Santa gave me a comic book.[/i]
# #[i]It was some series set in a medieval kingdom ruled by a cruel frog king.[/i]
# #[i]The main character inherited an apothecary from their uncle, and saved the kingdom through the power of potions and friendship.[/i]
# #[i]I was reading it at school one day, sitting alone at the lunch tables, when a girl from the grade above approached me.[/i]
# #[i]She told me that was her favorite series, and we ended up talking for that whole hour.[/i]
# fix this
[i]And when I brought it to school when we got back from break, someone recognized it and talked to me.
[i]That’s how I made my first friend.

# #[i]Honestly, regardless of the gifts, I just remember how much I loved writing the letter in the first place.[/i]
# #[i]I used to be so diligent in my letter writing.[/i]
[i]I can’t remember why or how, but one day I stopped writing to Santa.[/i]
[i]Maybe I wanted to grow up too fast.[/i]
[i]Maybe... I should let myself believe in magic again, at least for a little while.[/i]
[i]Letter to Santa…[/i]
[i]Why not…[/i]

[i]I give $5 to the strange elf man, grab one of the themed letter sheets, and sit down to write.[/i]
