[i]I arrived early to the Jingle Jangle since my parents dragged me to join them. I should have known they were planning on going.[/i]
[i]After watching my parents and their friends become tipsy off of spiked eggnog, I realized it was time to meet Nico.[/i]

[i]I meandered toward the assemblage of lights that surrounded the town’s gaudy unlit Christmas tree...[/i]
[i]And notice a man with curly chestnut hair, searching the faces of the crowd with a slightly concerned expression.[/i]
[i]That must be him.[/i]
{mc}\: Nico!
# #[i]Nico doesn’t notice me. My gait increases into a light jog. My coat trails behind me in the snow. [/i]
# #{mc}\: Nico! I’m over here!

[i]He turns around, and his [b]blue orbs[/b] twinkle in the Christmas lights. [/i]
# [i]Although the Christmas decorations at the Jingle Jangle are a bit too garish for my tastes, his eyes remind me of home. [/i]
# #[i]For some reason, I begin to think about my childhood nights, my family sitting around a warm fireplace, and the smell of {fav.drink}.[/i]
{n}\: Oh, hey {name.first}! I was worried you got lost on the way here. The snowy roads can be hard to navigate in the dark.
{mc}\: It really wasn’t that bad.
{n}\: Well, I’m glad you survived and that you made it here!
{mc}\: Thanks…
