{n}\: {name.first}? You made it! And here I thought the Jingle Jangle “wasn’t your style?”
{mc}\: My parents dragged me out. Anyways, I was on my way back home. Sorry again for running into you.
{n}\: Don’t worry about it, I’m a chill guy.
{n}\: But since you’re already here, you might as well enjoy it!
{mc}\: I highly doubt I will enjoy this.
{n}\: Trust me.
{mc}\: …
{mc}\: Alright.
