[i]Light snow falls around us as we take our regular nighttime stroll.

{mc}\: You know, I actually wrote a letter to Santa this year.

{mc}\: Yeah… Pretty embarrassing, I know.
update christine (34/casual/neutral)
{n}\: Not at all! So… what did you ask for?
update christine (34/casual/happy)
{mc}\: I said I wanted {gimme}.
update christine (34/casual/neutral)
{n}\: <Great choice!/Interesting choice.../Oh!/So do I!/Classic!/I've never thought of that before./If I were you I'd keep that to myself.>

update christine (34/casual/sad)
{mc}\: Well… what I said I [i]really[/i] wanted is a sense of purpose.
{mc}\: Lately I’ve just been so unfulfilled. My life is just my career, and my career is just “how can we best exploit children and take all their money.”
{mc}\: Honestly, all I really want to do is… No, it’s stupid.

{n}\: What?! You can’t just stop now! Tell me!
{mc}\: [i][sighs]
{mc}\: I really just want to be a toymaker.
update nico [animation="Bounce"]
{n}\: !
{mc}\: Weird, I know.
{n}\: No, I think that’s really cool! What kind of toys do you want to make?
{mc}\: Ha, thanks. Any kind really! I have so many ideas...

{mc}\: You know, I naively thought that claw machines could be the bridge to take me there, since they’re made for kids.
update christine (34/casual/sad)
{mc}\: But the claw machine industry… it’s so corrupt…
update christine (34/casual/happy)
{mc}\: Maybe I should’ve asked Santa for a job instead!
update nico [animation="Bounce"]
update christine (34/casual/neutral)
{n}\: [i][laughs]
{n}\: Let’s say Santa just gave you full control of the workshop, what’s the first thing you’re making?

- A fuzzy creature
	join christine (front/casual/headshot/neutral) center
	{mc}\: Kids are drawn to strange and uncanny things, right?
	update christine (front/casual/headshot/happy)
	{mc}\: So why not give them one they can treat as a little pet?
	update christine [animation="Bounce"]
	{mc}\: Oh, and they've [i]got[/i] to make noises. And turn on randomly in the middle of the night!
	join christine (34/casual/neutral) center
	{mc}\: And for design, it should look like a weird owl or hamster hybrid, but like super creepy!
	update christine (34/casual/happy)
	{mc}\: I'd call it, the Purby!
- Versatile video game console
	join christine (front/casual/headshot/neutral) center
	{mc}\: You know, since they came out with the Microvision in recent years, handheld video games have gotten more popular.
	update christine (front/casual/headshot/happy)
	{mc}\: Why not have one that you can attach to your home console?
	join christine (34/casual/neutral) center
	{mc}\: That way, you can take your games on the go [i]and[/i] play comfortably at home! And you'd have access to your save files no matter where you are!
	update christine (34/casual/happy)
	{mc}\: I'd call it, the Swish!

[i]He pulls out a cassette tape with a red ribbon tied around it.

[i]On the front of the tape it reads, "for {name.first}" with two badly drawn snowmen holding hands.
[i]He taped the song list to the otherside, and my breath catches when I read the first track.
update christine [animation="Bounce"]
{mc}\: [i]{fav.song}[/i]?! That’s my favorite Christmas song!

{n}\: [i][laughs][/i]
{n}\: That’s why I added it.
{n}\: I know you’re planning to go back to the big city soon, so when you’re there, you can listen to this tape and remember your time here.
update nico (34/casual/blush)
{n}\: And hopefully remember me too…
{mc}\: Nico…
