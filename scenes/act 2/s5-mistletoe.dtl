[i]Light snow falls around us as we take our regular nighttime stroll.
{mc}\: You know, I actually wrote a letter to Santa this year.
{n}\: Whaaaaat? Really?
{mc}\: Yeah… Pretty embarrassing, I know.
{n}\: Not at all! So… what did you ask for?
{mc}\: I said I wanted {gimme}.
{n}\: <Great choice!/Interesting choice.../Oh!/So do I!/Classic!/I've never thought of that before./If I were you I'd keep that to myself.>

{mc}\: Well… what I said I [i]really[/i] wanted is a sense of purpose.
{mc}\: Lately I’ve just been so unfulfilled. My life is just my career, and my career is just “how can we best exploit children and take all their money.”
{mc}\: Honestly, all I really want to do is… No, it’s stupid.
{n}\: What?! You can’t just stop now! Tell me!

{mc}\: [i][sighs]
{mc}\: I really just want to be a toymaker.
{n}\: !
{mc}\: Weird, I know.
{n}\: No, I think that’s really cool! What kind of toys do you want to make?
{mc}\: Ha, thanks. Any kind really! I have so many ideas...
{mc}\: You know, I naively thought that claw machines could be the bridge to take me there, since they’re made for kids.
{mc}\: But the claw machine industry… it’s so corrupt…
{mc}\: Maybe I should’ve asked Santa for a job instead!

{n}\: [i][laughs]
{n}\: Let’s say Santa just gave you full control of the workshop, what’s the first thing you’re making?
{mc}\: Hmmm, let’s see…

- A fuzzy creature
	{mc}\: Kids are drawn to strange and uncanny things, right?
	{mc}\: So why not give them one they can treat as a little pet?
	{mc}\: Oh, and they've [i]got[/i] to make noises. And turn on randomly in the middle of the night!
	{mc}\: And for design, it should look like a weird owl or hamster hybrid, but like super creepy!
	{mc}\: I'd call it, the Purby!
- Versatile video game console
	{mc}\: You know, since they came out with the Microvision in recent years, handheld video games have gotten more popular.
	{mc}\: Why not have one that you can attach to your home console?
	{mc}\: That way, you can take your games on the go [i]and[/i] play comfortably at home! And you'd have access to your save files no matter where you are!
	{mc}\: I'd call it, the Swish!
{n}\: …
{mc}\: What? You don't like my idea?
{n}\: No, it’s just… your eyes… right now they’re just [i][b]sparkling.

{mc}\: ?!
{n}\: Haha, sorry… Ignore me…
{mc}\: No, um… Thank you.

# insert kiss scene???

{n}\: Here, I want you to have this.
[i]He pulls out a cassette tape with a red ribbon tied around it.
{mc}\: You made me a mixtape?! How long did this take you?
[i]On the front of the tape it reads, "for {name.first}" with two badly drawn snowmen holding hands.
[i]He taped the song list to the otherside, and my breath catches when I read the first track.
{mc}\: [i]{fav.song}[/i]?! That’s my favorite Christmas song!
[sound path="res://Audio/SFX/laugh-105488.mp3" volume="6.0"]
{n}\: [i][laughs][/i]
{n}\: That’s why I added it.
{n}\: I know you’re planning to go back to the big city soon, so when you’re there, you can listen to this tape and remember your time here.
{n}\: And hopefully remember me too…
{mc}\: Nico…
