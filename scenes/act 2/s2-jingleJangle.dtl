[i]An awkward air settles between us, but it’s interrupted by a bell tolling in the distance.[/i]
[background arg="res://art/backgrounds/JingleJangleChristmasTree.PNG" fade="1.0"]
[i]Background conversations fade away, and we all look towards the tree as the lights turn on, one by one.[/i]
[wait_input]
[i]Although I like to think I’m all grown-up, I have to admit that I couldn’t help but feel a bit of childlike wonder.[/i]
[i]Even though there are so many people in the big city, it’s easy to feel alone.[/i]
[i]But here, it really feels like there’s a community. Every single person in this town gathered in the piercing cold to watch a couple of lights turn on together.[/i]
[wait_input]
[i]And I couldn’t help but notice how cinematically Nico’s glasses reflected the lights.[/i]
[i]It looked as if his eyes were filled with a million glittering stars.[/i]
[wait_input]

[i]The ceremony comes to a close as the sunburst on the top of the tree lights up.[/i]
[i][applause][i]
[background arg="res://art/backgrounds/JingleJangle Cafe.PNG" fade="1.0"]
[i]The crowd begins to disperse and Nico and I make our way over to the coffee booth.
BARISTA\: Nico! How’ve you been?
{n}\: I’ve been great! But you know how busy this season can get for me, haha. How are you?
BARISTA\: I’ve been good! And don’t worry about the drink man, it’s on me.
{n}\: C'mon, I couldn’t do that to you. I’ll pay, I insist.
BARISTA\: No, [i]I[/i] insist.
{n}\: In that case, I’ll pay for her drink then.
{n}\: One hot chocolate for me, and one {fav.drink} for her.
[i]Nico pays the barista and we step off to the side while we wait.[/i]
{mc}\: You didn’t have to do that… but thank you.
[i]We begin to explore the market together, drinks in hand, and I take a sip out of mine.
{mc}\: Wow! That’s amazing…
{mc}\: You know, {fav.drink} is actually my favorite.
{n}\: Really? I’m glad I ordered it for you then.

# #NICO GETS KNOCKED OFF THE SCREEN
[i][b][THUD]
GUY WHO LOOKS LIKE HIS NAME SHOULD BE BIFF\: Hey, [b]WATCH IT!
[i]Nico is struggling to get up, his cup of hot chocolate spilling out into a puddle next to him.[/i]
[i]What should I do?[/i]
- Help Nico
	join christine right [z_index=200]
	[i]I run over to Nico’s side, offering him my hand and pulling him up off the dirt.
	join christine left [z_index="200"]
	join nico right
	{mc}\: Are you alright?
	{n}\: Haha, well. I guess I could be better.
	[i]He gazes at the growing puddle of hot chocolate on the ground.
	{n}\: My hot choccy…
	{mc}\: This in unacceptable…
	[i]I turn around and spot the man who ran into Nico lingering near by.[i]
	{mc}\: Hey!
	join christine center [z_index="200"]
	{mc}\: What’s your damage, man?

- Confront the guy who ran into him
	join christine center
	{mc}\: What’s your damage, man?

[i]He slowly turns towards me, a look of disbelief written on his face.[/i]
You talking to me?
{mc}\: Yeah, I am.
{mc}\: You ran into my friend and completely obliterated his hot chocolate.
{mc}\: You need to apologize.
“BIFF”\: [i][laughs]
“BIFF”\: Sure.
{mc}\: Do you think you can just bully people however you please?
BYSTANDER 1\: Did he just run into Nico?
BYSTANDER 2\: Oh my god! His hot chocolate!!
{mc}\: Like I said, apologize, [b][i]now.
"BIFF"\: Take a chill pill lady.
{mc}\: [b][i]Eat[pause=0.5] my[pause=0.5] shorts.
[i]Completely torn apart by this devastating blow I’ve just dealt him, tears begin to well in his eyes.
“BIFF”\: Fine, fine, I’m sorry! Happy now? Just leave me alone!
[i]He runs away defeated, slips on the puddle of hot chocolate, and face plants into the snow.

[i]I turn to Nico.
{mc}\: What’s [i]his[/i] problem? Here, I can buy you another hot chocolate.
{n}\: It’s alright don’t worry about it, but thank you.
{n}\: …and thank you for standing up for me.
{n}\: No one’s ever actually stuck up for me like that before…
{mc}\: What??
{mc}\: I find that hard to believe. It seems like everyone here loves you.
{n}\: Not that guy apparently.
{mc}\: Whatever, you know what I mean.
{mc}\: But how has no one ever done that for you before?
{n}\: I mean honestly, I kind of stick to myself.
{mc}\: Well, no one should be talking to you like that. I’ve only known you for a day but you’re like the sweetest guy I’ve ever met.
{n}\: Oh uh… thanks…
{mc}\: No problem…

[i]Again an awkward lull settles over us, but it doesn’t last long.
[i]As Nico and I begin to explore the market together, he tells me stories about the history of this town.
[i]At first I didn’t say much, but as the night dragged on, I could feel myself opening up, allowing myself to smile, to laugh.
[i]His joy and enthusiasm was infectious, even to my cold city girl heart.
[i]A snowball fight breaks out among the kids, and Nico decides to join in.
[i]He throws a snowball at me. I throw one back.
[wait_input]
{mc}\: Ah! Is it already this late? I really should be going back.
Before you go, I forgot to give you something! I got this for you earlier.
[i]He hands me a small paper bag.
[i]Inside the bag were cookies, specifically {fav.cookie}.
How did you…. These are my favorite cookies.
I saw you eyeing them earlier. You had a [i]very[/i] intense expression.
{mc}\: Oh, shut up…
{mc}\: Well, thank you regardless. This was… fun…
{n}\: See! I told you that you wouldn’t regret it!
{n}\: Get home safe!
[i]Nico waves energetically as I walk away, and I give him a small wave in return.
[i]I smile to myself, already reminiscing about the memories I made tonight…
[i]But for whatever reason, I can’t help but also feel a bit… [pause=0.3]sad? [pause=0.3]Disappointed?
[i]Why?
{n}\: Wait, {name.first}!
[i]I turn around, and Nico is right behind me, face flushed and out of breath.
{n}\: So if you end up liking those cookies, you’ve got to check out the bakery in town!
{n}\: Those cookies are good, but fresh? Absolutely phenomenal!
{n}\: Would you want to… I mean only if you want to! I don’t want you to feel-
{mc}\: I’d love to.
