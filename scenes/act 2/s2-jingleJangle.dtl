[i]An awkward air settles between us, but it’s interrupted by a bell tolling in the distance.[/i]
[i]Background conversations fade away, and we all look towards the tree as the lights turn on, one by one.[/i]
[wait_input]
[i]Although I like to think I’m all grown-up, I have to admit that I couldn’t help but feel a bit of childlike wonder.[/i]
[i]Even though there are so many people in the big city, it’s easy to feel alone.[/i]
[i]But here, it really feels like there’s a community. Every single person in this town gathered in the piercing cold to watch a couple of lights turn on together.[/i]
[wait_input]
[i]And I couldn’t help but notice how cinematically Nico’s glasses reflected the lights.[/i]
[i]It looked as if his eyes were filled with a million glittering stars.[/i]
[wait_input]

[i]The ceremony comes to a close as the sunburst on the top of the tree lights up.[/i]
[i][applause][i]
[i]The crowd begins to disperse and Nico and I make our way over to the coffee booth.
BARISTA\: Nico! How’ve you been?
{n}\: I’ve been great! But you know how busy this season can get for me, haha. How are you?
BARISTA\: I’ve been good! And don’t worry about the drink, it’s on me.
{n}\: Jackson, I couldn’t do that to you, I’ll pay, I insist.
BARISTA\: No, [i]I[/i] insist.
{n}\: Well, in that case, I’ll pay for her drink then.
{n}\: One hot chocolate for me, and one {fav.drink} for her.
[i]Nico pays the barista and we step off to the side while we wait.[/i]
{mc}\: You didn’t have to do that… [pause=0.3] but thank you.
[i]Another barista calls Nico’s name and he picks up the drinks for us.[/i]
[i]We begin to explore the market together, and I take a sip out of mine.
{mc}\: Wow! That’s amazing…
{mc}\: You know, {fav.drink} is actually my favorite thing to drink during the holidays.
{n}\: Really? I’m glad I ordered it for you then.
# #NICO GETS KNOCKED OFF THE SCREEN
GUY WHO LOOKS LIKE HIS NAME SHOULD BE BIFF\: Hey, [b]WATCH IT!
[i]Nico is struggling to get up, his cup of hot chocolate spilling out into a puddle next to him.[/i]
[i]What should I do?[/i]
- Help Nico
	[i]I run over to Nico’s side, offering him my hand and pulling him up off the dirt.
	{mc}\: Are you alright?
	{n}\: Haha, well. I guess I got be better.
	[i]He gazes at the growing puddle of hot chocolate on the ground.
	{n}\: My hot choccy…
	{mc}\: This in unacceptable…
	[i]I turn around and spot the man who ran into Nico lingering near by.[i]
	{mc}\: Hey!
	{mc}\: What’s your damage, man?
	[i]He slowly turns towards me, a look of disbelief written on his face.[/i]

- Confront the guy who ran into him
	{mc}\: What’s yo	ur damage, man?

[i]He slowly turns towards me, a look of disbelief written on his face.[/i]
You talking to me?
{mc}\: Yeah, I am.
{mc}\: You ran into my friend and completely obliterated his hot chocolate.
{mc}\: You need to apologize, [b][i]now.
“BIFF”\: [i][laughs]
“BIFF”\: Take a chill pill lady.
{mc}\: Bite me.
“BIFF”\: What did you just say to me?
[i]A crowd starts to form around us, drawn to the commotion.[/i]
{mc}\: Do you think you’re better than other people?
{mc}\: That you can just bully people however you please?
BYSTANDER 1\: Did he just run into Nico?
BYSTANDER 2\: Oh my god! His hot chocolate!!
{mc}\: Well, you can’t. And you’re not better than anyone.
{mc}\: In fact, you’re nothing more than a
[i]The guy seems to grow more and more nervous as more people surround us.
You better shut up now before it’s too late.
If you keep this up, you’re gonna be sorry.
{mc}\: [b][i]Eat[pause=0.5] my[pause=0.5] shorts.
[i]Completely torn apart by this devastating blow I’ve just dealt him, tears begin to well in his eyes.
“BIFF”\: Fine, fine, I’m sorry! Happy now? Just leave me alone!
[i]He runs away defeated, slips on the puddle of hot chocolate, and face plants into the snow.
# call back to Alex lol

[i]I turn to Nico.
{mc}\: What’s his problem?
{n}\: He’s just going through something right now. His mom died.
{mc}\: Well, regardless I’m really sorry you had to deal with that.
{mc}\: I can buy you another hot chocolate.
{n}\: It’s alright don’t worry about it, but thank you.
{n}\: …and thank you for standing up for me.
{n}\: No one’s ever actually stuck up for me like that before…
{mc}\: What??
{mc}\: I find that hard to believe. It seems like everyone here loves you.
{n}\: Not that guy apparently.
{mc}\: Whatever, you know what I mean.
{mc}\: You’re like a bundle of fluff, how come no one’s done that for you before?
{n}\: I mean honestly, I kind of stick to myself.
{mc}\: Well, no one should be talking to you like that. I’ve only known you for a day but you’re like the sweetest guy I’ve ever met.
{n}\: Oh uh… thanks…
{mc}\: No problem…

[i]Again an awkward lull settles over us, but it doesn’t last long.
[i]As Nico and I begin to explore the market together, he tells me stories about the history of this town.
[i]At first I didn’t say much, but as the night dragged on, I could feel myself opening up, allowing myself to smile, to laugh.
[i]His joy and enthusiasm was infectious, even to my cold city girl heart.
[i]A snowball fight breaks out among the kids, and Nico decides to join in.
[i]He throws a snowball at me. I throw one back.
[wait_input]
{mc}\: Ah! Is it already this late? I really should be going back.
Before you go, I forgot to give you something! I got this for you earlier.
[i]He hands me a small paper bag.
[i]Inside the bag were cookies, specifically {fav.cookie}.
How did you…. These are my favorite cookies.
I saw you eyeing them earlier. You had a [i]very[/i] intense expression.
{mc}\: Oh, shut up…
{mc}\: Well, thank you regardless. This was… [pause=0.3]fun…
{n}\: See! I told you that you wouldn’t regret it!
{n}\: Get home safe!
[i]Nico waves energetically as I walk away, and I give him a small wave in return.
[i]I smile to myself, already reminiscing about the memories I made tonight…
[i]But for whatever reason, I can’t help but also feel a bit… [pause=0.3]sad? [pause=0.3]Disappointed
[i]Why?
{n}\: Wait, {name.first}!
[i]I turn around, and Nico is right behind me, face flushed and out of breath.
{n}\: So if you end up liking those cookies, you’ve got to check out the bakery in town!
{n}\: Those cookies are good, but fresh? Absolutely phenomenal!
{n}\: Would you want to… I mean only if you want to! I don’t want you to feel-
{mc}\: I’d love to.
